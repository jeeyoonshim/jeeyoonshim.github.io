        DESIGN + CODE

        DESIGN + PROGRAMMING

        ART + CODE
        <br />
        
        I studied Graphic Design at Maryland Institute College of Art. My interest in code was pipqued with taking a class in Generative Typography in which we used Processing, a coding language, to generate and create art. I was fascinated. 
        
        <br />
        <br />
        Fast forward to 2023, and I began pursuing programming as a career change, learning Fullstack using the MERN stack. I applied my knowledge of design systems and UX/UI and incorporated that with programming. Things that I've learned before came in handy, including loops and objects, while I learned new skills with the backend side of things — like making a server, a database, and accessing all those routes. 

        <br />
        <br />
        I'm very good at taking concepts and breaking them down so it's easier to explain to professionals from other disciplines. I'd like to credit that to my Graphic Design/Art History background. I'm a fast learner, adaptable and flexible and excel at working in teams.
